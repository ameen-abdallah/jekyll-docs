# TechnoPlayground documentation site
{: .fs-9 }

This will be the documentation site for some of the posts on[TechnoPlayground] and as a reference for myself. I am hoping this site will, with time, have a lot of useful documentation.

TechnoPlayground is a site i have started with the aim of blogging and posting about some of the projects i am doing at home. Learning new things and skills take time and you really only learn by going out of your comfort zone.
In my professional life, i am a software engineer, mostly working with .Net C# on MS Windows, at least for the last 15 years. Earlier i have worked with other languages like Modula-2, but that is just history now, i guess.


TechnoPlayground is my playground to learn and play with things i am not using everyday, or maybe using everyday but in different ways. i am hopping to play with other operating systems, like Linux different distribution, with self hosting, security, dockers and Kubernetes, web pages, and other things that i can learn something from.
